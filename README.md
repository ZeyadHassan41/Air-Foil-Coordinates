# Air-Foil-Coordinates

A simple tool to manage, visualize, and export airfoil coordinate data. Designed for educational or aerodynamic design workflows, this project enables users to work with airfoil `.dat` files or custom coordinate formats and view 2D profiles.

---

##  Features

- Load and parse airfoil coordinates from `.dat` or `.txt` files.
- Visualize airfoil shapes in 2D.
- Export processed or normalized coordinates.
- (Optional) Support for smoothing or interpolating coordinate data.
- Easily extendable to integrate with aerodynamic analysis tools like XFoil or NeuralFoil.
